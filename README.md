# Swords n Souls

I made this game for Itch.io's [Mini Jam 70](https://itch.io/jam/mini-jam-70-heaven). The theme was 'heaven' and the limitation was 'player must be an inanimate object'. This was my first time created a fully "finished" game so I didn't really know what to expect.

The game can be played [here](https://jlarminay.itch.io/swords-n-souls).

I used the Godot game engine and as I am terrible at art and music, I used a lot of free assets. All credits can be found in the game itself.

After the event was finished, I wrote a post mortem of the process, what I thought went well, and what could be done better next time. It can be read [here](https://jlarminay.itch.io/swords-n-souls/devlog/210289/post-mortem).
